    description: `Gig work is very common during this uncertain time that we live in: the DoorDasher who delivers your food is a type of online platform worker or the Uber driver who picks you up and drops you off where you need to go. Gig workers enter into formal agreements with on-demand companies to provide services to the company's clients. They perform important tasks on their own and contribute significantly to our society. However, they are quite different from people who have white collar jobs not just because they donâ€™t work a 9-5. Career development is vital for ensuring a happy and productive workforce for all workers, yet career development is largely ignored in gig work. Research has summarized that gig work platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) do not support gig workers in reskilling and changing careers. After studying the career goals of gig workers and the challenges they face in trying to transition out of gig work and into high-skill jobs offline or into specialized freelance work, mental health becomes a specific topic to understand what is changing these gig workers' well being and helps me to envision a more worker-centric platform. Our current goal is to understand mental health and social support for gig workers through analyzing online forums and conducting interviews with experienced gig workers.`,

    Purely analytical modeling would struggle to capture the complex interactions and dynamics involved, but a computational approach through multiagent reinforcement learning has great potential as demonstrated by the AI Economist approach to designing tax policy.`,
